# SmartLife 🌱  
SmartLife is a virtual life management system built with ASP.NET Core MVC and MySQL. It allows users to create, edit, and manage digital profiles that simulate simplified human traits such as mood, occupation, personality, and wealth.

## ✨ Overview
This project showcases a lightweight life simulation platform, where each digital entity represents a character in a simplified world. Users can view, create, update, and delete characters through a clean, structured MVC web interface.

Beyond its surface, SmartLife is a backend-driven application emphasizing clean architecture, data handling, and extendable logic design — suitable for further development into gamified simulations, habit tracking tools, or personality-based recommendation engines.
